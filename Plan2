Market analysis : 

Industrial analysis :   

As per the 12 th five-Year plan(2012 - 2017) only a very small percentage of the Indians receive formal vocational education, whereas in other countries the percentage are as follows.

Whereas in India it is less than 5 %. 

Now after the release of NEP , more focus is given on the vocational education where students from secondary education are exposed to the many vocational courses. Later in their higher secondary they are given option to choose any one vocational course and pursue u it. This creating a huge opportunity for skilled teachers and tools. 

Customer analysis : 

The main point of the reimagining vocational education proposed in the NEP stated at at least 50 % of the schools in India should start vocational education from higher secondary by 2025. And Karnataka is the first state to start implementing NEP from this academic year creating a huge opportunity.  

And from past few years Parenting has been matured and the relations between parents and children’s have changed drastically. Now the parents are not much worried about marks but are in interested in the skill development of their children.
